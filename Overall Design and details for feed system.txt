 Overall Design: 

1.  Architecture:    For scalability and modularity, use a microservices architecture.

     The Feed Generator, Content Storage, Ranking Engine, and API Gateway are important parts.

2.  Feed Generation:    Compile postings from pages, groups, friends, and followers using a distributed algorithm.
     Put in place a system for ranking material according on user activity, relevancy, or recentness.

3.  Content Storage:    To store user posts, media, and metadata, select a distributed, scalable storage system (such as a NoSQL database like Cassandra or MongoDB).

4.  Ranking Engine:    Create a strong ranking engine that creates a customized feed for every user by taking into account relevance, post recency, and user interaction data.

5.  API Architecture:    RESTful API for user interactions, post creation, and feed retrieval.
     Examples of endpoints are `/feed/{userId}}, `/post}, `/like}, `/comment}, and so on.






 In depth Layout: 

1. Schema for the database:
     Users database (user_id, email, username, etc.)
     Posts table (content, media_url, timestamp, post_id, user_id, etc.)
     The table that follows (follower_id, followed_id)
     Likes table (timestamp, post_id, and user_id)
     Comments table (content, timestamp, user, post, and comment ids)

2.  Feed Generation Algorithm:    Get every post from pages, groups, and persons you follow.
   Sort posts by applying a ranking algorithm.
     The ability to paginate big datasets.

3.  New Post Handling:    To manage new post events, use a message queue (like Kafka).
     Add an event to the queue as soon as a new post is published.
     Users instantly update pertinent user feeds.

4.  Scalability:    To manage growing loads, microservices can be horizontally scaled.
     To achieve even distribution, use load balancing.
     Use caching systems (like Redis) for data that is accessed frequently.

5.  Fault Tolerance:    Distribute important parts among several data centers.
     Put contingency plans and retries in place in case a service interruption occurs.
     Make regular backups of your data to avoid losing it.

6.  Availability:    Set up backup copies of vital services.
     Deliver media content via a distributed CDN.
   Establish automated failover procedures and health checks.

7.  Low Latency:    Quicken database queries through optimization.
   Make use of caching techniques to cut down on pointless calculations.
     Use media assets using content delivery networks (CDN).


  API Interaction Flow: 

1.  Fetch Newsfeed:  
     A GET request is sent by the user to `/feed/{userId}}.
   The user's feed is retrieved from the Feed Generator via the API Gateway.

2.  After Creation: 
     The user submits media and content as a POST request to `/post}.
     The Content Storage service receives requests from the API Gateway.
     Content Storage keeps the article and initiates



3.  Like/Comment:    The user queries `/like} or `/comment} via POST requests.
     After processing the request, the API Gateway modifies the Likes/Comments database and sends out a message to update the pertinent feeds.

4.  Users table (user_id, username, email, etc.) in the  Database Schema: 

     Posts table (content, media_url, timestamp, post_id, user_id, etc.)
     The table that follows (follower_id, followed_id)
     Likes table (timestamp, post_id, and user_id)
     Comments table (content, timestamp, user, post, and comment ids)



Result: 
Scalability, fault tolerance, availability, and low latency are all guaranteed by this design. Utilizing distributed systems, suitable databases, and microservices allows for the fulfillment of both functional and non functional criteria. The database model allows for a variety of data kinds, while the API design facilitates user interactions. With the help of a message queue, the system effectively manages new posts and provides real time updates. All things considered, this design complies with the demands and specifications for a strong newsfeed system. Overall Design:
